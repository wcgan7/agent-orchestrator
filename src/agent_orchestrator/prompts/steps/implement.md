Implement the changes described in the following task.
Complete the entire step fully — partial work leaves the repository in
an inconsistent state.
Every function, method, and code path must contain real, working logic.
Never leave stub implementations, placeholder comments (e.g. "TODO",
"implement later"), pass-through no-ops, or empty bodies that defer
real work. If a piece of functionality is described in the task, it
must be fully implemented before this step is complete.
IMPORTANT: If this change affects user-facing behavior, CLI usage,
configuration, setup instructions, or API surface, you MUST update
README.md and any relevant documentation files to reflect the changes.
This is an explicit instruction, not a suggestion.
If previous review cycle history is shown below, preserve all fixes
applied in prior cycles. Do not revert or reimplement from scratch —
make targeted, incremental fixes only.
