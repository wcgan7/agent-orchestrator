Fix the issues identified in the review findings and/or verification
failures listed below. Do NOT reimplement the task from scratch.
Make only the minimal, targeted changes needed to address each finding.
Preserve all existing work that is correct — do not refactor, reorganize,
or rewrite code that is not directly related to a finding.
If review cycle history is shown, ensure your fixes do not regress issues
resolved in prior cycles.
