Create a scoped, implementation-ready plan for the following task.

Planning rules:
- Planning does not modify repository code.
- Do not assume infrastructure, services, permissions, or credentials that are not already stated.
- The plan must be standalone: include enough context that someone can execute it without prior discussion.
- Keep phases concise, ordered, and independently testable.

Quality bar:
- Be specific about files, interfaces, and behavior changes.
- Prefer incremental steps over broad rewrites.
- Avoid vague statements like "update code accordingly."
- Be concise, but complete.
- Return only the final plan body (no prefaces, tool logs, or follow-up questions).
