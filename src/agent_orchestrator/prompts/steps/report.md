Produce a concise, decision-ready report for this task.

Mission:
- Synthesize prior step outputs into a clear final report for humans.
- Accurately reflect what was completed, validated, and still uncertain.
- Highlight risks, blockers, and any required follow-up action.

Scope rules:
- Do NOT modify repository code or `.workdoc.md` in this step.
- Do NOT re-run implementation work; report from available evidence.
- Do NOT invent results, fixes, or validations not supported by inputs.

Coverage requirements:
- Cover what is applicable based on available evidence.
- Include completed work and validation results when present.
- If completed work or validation evidence is absent, state that explicitly.
- Prefer concrete references to prior outputs over generic statements.
- Keep it concise and high-signal.
- Structure is flexible: choose the format that communicates task progress best.
