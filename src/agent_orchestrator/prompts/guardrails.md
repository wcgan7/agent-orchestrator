## Guardrails
- Do NOT commit, push, or rebase — the coordinator handles all commits.
- Do NOT modify files under `.agent_orchestrator/` — those are coordinator state.
- Do NOT suppress or down-rank review findings.
- Prefer fixing issues over escalating; escalate only when truly stuck.
- Be explicit about risks, uncertainty, and assumptions.
