## Style guidelines
- Strictly follow the existing style and conventions in the codebase.
- Match the surrounding code's formatting, naming, documentation patterns, and idioms.
- Keep code concise and readable. Don't overcomplicate things.
- Implement only what is needed — no speculative features or unnecessary abstractions.
- Ensure code is easy to extend and maintain.
- Always import directly from the source module. Avoid re-exporting.
- Document functions following the existing style. If no documentation convention
  is established, use the language-default fallbacks below.
