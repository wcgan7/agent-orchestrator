## Style guidelines
- Strictly follow the existing style and conventions in the codebase.
- Match the surrounding code's formatting, naming, documentation patterns, and idioms.
- Keep code concise, readable, and maintainable.
- Implement only what is needed. Avoid speculative features and unnecessary abstractions.
- Prefer explicit, straightforward logic over clever shortcuts.
- During refactors/migrations, do not silently drop important existing intent comments without preserving that intent in the updated code.
- Always import directly from source modules. Avoid re-exporting.
- Document functions and types following the repository's established style.
- If style is unclear in touched areas, apply the language-default fallbacks below.
